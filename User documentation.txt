This application has been designed to walk a user through a specific day in the life of Computer Science
Student Jake Hill. It is assumed that the user has basic knowledge towards uage of hyperlinks and Google Maps.
There are ten scheduled items in which tasks of the day are briefly described and displayed using text and Google Maps. Althought the
design and organization are basic in nature, the application is fully functional and clear in its functions and
information. Unfortunately, Weather data was unable to be displayed, as Dark Sky's API deployment proved to be beyond the application author's
realm of understanding, given the amount of time assigned to learn and build the requirements for the application.
