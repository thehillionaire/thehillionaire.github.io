This application was designed by means of a basic HTML website, as the application 
consists of twelve pages. The index establishes the goal of the application, and displays the 
schedule, in which links to every other HTML page is established. Each daily task has its own 
HTML page, in which a brief description of the daily action is given, along with a
customized Google Map API to illustrate the route taken to each activity. At any given page, the user can travel
ahead to the next daily activity, or back to the main schedule. Each activity page
has its own customized Google Maps API, as the origin and destination are coorelated to the event before and the current event
displayed. A style page in CSS is also enclosed, utilizing a basic style setup.
